introduction and transition to products list

<p>
    Hi there, my name is Mark, and I enjoy writing apps and helping others learn to create on their own.
    <br>
    I currently have one product in market:<br>
    <a href={{ site.url | append: "/collections/ppl/pplMain.html"}}>Push. Pull. Legs.</a>
</p>

<h3>Bells and Whistles</h3>
<p>
    I like to write simple apps that serve a sole purpose. For me, most apps do too much, and I find the extraneous
    features to be burdensome. To be honest, I don't like a large portion of apps simply because
    they're bloated with extra features that are meant to take up more of your time by ensuring longer periods of user engagement.
    Apps should be useful, not distracting or intentionally time consuming. Efficiency is key, and I aim to provide just that.
</p>
<h3>Ads</h3>
<p>
    My apps have advertisements to support my business. If you want to get rid of the ads, I provide the ability to
    do so through a small transaction.
